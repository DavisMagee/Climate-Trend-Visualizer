# Climate-Trend-Visualizer
This program takes in a .txt file containing the daily minimum temperatures for weather stations and outputs a chart showcasing the trend of how many days were below freezing per winter season changes over time.

This program was created for a senior research project conducted by Davis Magee and oversaw by Dr. Johna Rudzin at Mississippi State University.

The file Climate-Trend-Visualizer.py contains the main python file. Some parts of the file need to be manually adjusted depending on the data file. 
1. The file input line must match the name of your data input file.
2. If the weather station is in the southern hemisphere the date range of the winter season will need to be changed.
3. Chart titles, axis labels, and axis values may need to be manually adjusted.

The .txt file is acquired through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental Information website. It is tabulated and the only values requested are Station, Station Name, Date, and Tmin.
If different values are requested by the user the code will likely need adjustment.

Any questions about the project should be directed to Davis Magee at davis.magee01@gmail.com
